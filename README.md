## Nonograms game
This is final project for Stage #1 of the JavaScript/Front-end 2023Q4 course.

Nonograms is a puzzle game to reveal a hidden picture by looking at the number clues. The clues are given at the top and left side of the grid. Each number in these clue defines a block of black cell. A number indicates an unbroken line of black cells, and they are in the same order as the lines. These puzzles are often black and white—describing a binary image—but they can also be colored.
